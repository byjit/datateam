# Datateam

This project named "Datateam" is a DataOps AI Agent â€” a system that automates the full lifecycle of dataset generation and processing. It sits between raw data and model training, doing the heavy lifting: collecting, cleaning, augmenting, validating, and preparing high-quality datasets.

It can perform the following actions:
1. data collection from web
2. Pre-processing (Cleaning, formatting, parsing, normalizing)
3. Synthetic data generation
4. Data validation
5. Taxonomy generation
6. Data augmentation
7. Output generation (e.g., CSV, JSON, etc.)
